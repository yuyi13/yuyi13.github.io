## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney, and a visiting scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). I am interested in using data-driven methods to better understand fine-scale land-atmosphere interactions in the context of climate extremes (e.g., drought and heatwave). My PhD explored the role of land surface temperature in improving spatiotemporal predictability of soil moisture-related agricultural drought. I also worked on an ANU-CSIRO Himawari-8 project that aimed at developing best-practice geostationary data products for enhanced sub-daily monitoring of Australiaâ€™s ecosystems.
