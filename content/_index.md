        I am currently working on the development of mechanism-driven deep learning model to enable enhanced spatial agricultural modelling at the USYD Precision Agriculture Lab. I am also involved in a few industry-aligned projects focusing on interdisciplinary challenges in agricultural innovation and climate science, leveraging statistical methodologies and high-performance computing (HPC) resources.
        
        Previously, I developed a variant of a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm to enhance the accuracy of downscaled land surface temperature (LST) data, alongside which I released a benchmark dataset to support future algorithmic refinements.
        
        I also contributed to a Himawari-8 project that aimed at developing geostationary data products for enhanced sub-daily monitoring of Australiaâ€™s ecosystems, where I was responsible for the development of an LST product.
